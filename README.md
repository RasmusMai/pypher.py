# pypher.py
A Python 3.5.1 application for encoding and decoding common ciphers. Mainly a personal 'exercise' for algorithms.

Cracking Caesarian cipher currently only works in Linux using `/usr/share/dict/american-english`. Everything else, in theory, should with any Python 3.

I wrote this when I was still first learning Python, so this was pretty much an exercise with the language and Git.
